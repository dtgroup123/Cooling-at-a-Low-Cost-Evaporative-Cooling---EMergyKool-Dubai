# Cooling-at-a-Low-Cost-Evaporative-Cooling---EMergyKool-in Dubai
The use of conventional evaporative cooling has rapidly declined in the United States despite the fact that it has high potential for energy savings in dry climates. Evaporative systems are very competitive in terms of first cost and provide significant reductions in operating energy use, as well as peak-load reduction benefits. Significant market barriers, such as the cost of the prototype evaporative cooling systems and consumer perceptions of evaporative coolers being unable to maintain comfort conditions, still remain and can be addressed through improved systems integration. The cooling process works on the principle of evaporation of moisture. The fan of the cooler draws outside air through pads soaked with water. The evaporation of the water lowers the temperature of the air passing through the wet pads of the cooler. This cooled air is blown through an opening into the building. The movement of the cooled air is directed by the homeowner by means of ducts to appropriate areas around the home and exhausted from partially opened windows, doors or ceiling ducts.
